# Necessary folder structure

Before execution, the snakemake folder needs the following folders inside of it where the biom files and mapping files reside in:

- data/biom
- data/map 

Each biom and mapping file needs to be named the same, and be stored in the correct folders. For example: 

- data/biom/health_disease.biom
- data/map/health_disease.txt
