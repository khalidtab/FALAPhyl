# What independent terms do you want to test? "treatment+block" would test the input distance matrix partitions "treatment" and "block". The formula "treatment*block" would test "Treatment" as well as the interaction between the two terms. 
# Nestedness is not possible with this implementation of adonis, i.e, formula "Patient/Pockets", as the block Patient needs to be included in the R formula itself as well "strata = Patient". This will be implemented via a different snakemake workflow with other analyses related to nested data analysis
